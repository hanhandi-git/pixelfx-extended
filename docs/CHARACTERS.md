# Action characters

The cast shares the original 38 px skeleton, weapon grips, hit-stop and effect timing. Each costume
uses a readable silhouette, warm metal accents, cool ink shadows and strong material ramps. They are
authored as code; no Hades sprites or other external character assets are included. The named
characters below are original procedural likenesses: hair, silhouette and clothing cues only, never
copied sprite art, logos or other published assets.

The bone height and hand positions stay fixed. Costumes extend the rest silhouette to roughly
40–42 px; each actor exposes its actual `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`, mask and pixels. Feet stay at `(0, 0)`.
Pixel clusters, four-step material shading, a one-pixel outline and upper-left lighting are shared.
Weapons belong to the action: changing character preserves contact frames and grip alignment.
Cloth, ornaments and hair use bone-local geometry and the body's depth buffer, including turns.

## Use and preview

```js
import { createAct, posed, stockActor, CHARACTERS } from "pixelfx";
import * as slash from "pixelfx/fx/melee/sword-slash";

const action = createAct(slash, { x: 100, y: 120, character: "ember-duelist" });
const restingActor = stockActor(2, "moon-oracle");
const pixels = posed({ weapon: "bow", fx: 10, fy: -24 }, "laurel-ranger");
```

`createFx` accepts the same `character` option for effects that declare `meta.actor`.
Body-bound effects use the selected rest mask, so recoloring, freezing and dissolving follow the costume.
The default and unknown IDs select the existing stand-in; the original small actor still works at scale 1.

The gallery offers keyboard-accessible character cards and remembers the choice in the URL:
`/gallery/index.html?character=ember-duelist`.
Effects without a body keep their normal preview; use “查看角色动作” to try the selected character.
The main gallery shows character cards and a live sword-action preview above its effect grid, including
when `source=new` is active. The selected character also applies to effect tiles and the detail dialog,
and is preserved in the `character` URL parameter. Character selection and the effect source filter
are independent. The effect dialog also exposes the same selection under “character”.

```sh
node tools/characters.mjs --gif
node tools/act.mjs melee/sword-slash --character ember-duelist
node tools/act.mjs melee/sword-slash --character moon-oracle --sheet
node --test tests/characters.test.mjs
npm run build:web
```

The roster and animated previews are generated under `records/characters/`; acted sheets go under
`records/act/` with the character ID in the filename. The sheets contain the full performance, including
the character, target and effect; use nearest-neighbour filtering. Source lives in
`src/core/characters.js`, `src/core/costume.js` and the shared `rig.js`.

This character selection runs in the portable JavaScript runtime and H5 previews. Existing Cocos VFX
atlases contain the effect alone; use an acted sheet when a Cocos game needs the baked character performance.
